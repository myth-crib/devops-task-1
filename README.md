A: AWS Direct Connect enables you to securely connect your AWS environment to your on-premises data center or office location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic connection. This connection provides dedicated high speed, low latency connection, where your traffic bypasses ISPs in your network path. It provides a direct connection to the nearest AWS region which is also already connected to other AWS regions worldwide.
